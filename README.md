# Personal-Blog
Personal Blog is django web application.It enables admin or staff members to create,delete or update the post.Each post is under different categories
and admin or staff members can add the categories.While creating the post user can choose the category in which user wants to create a post.Also the visitors if they are registered on blog can comment or reply to comment on the post and also share or like the post on facebook.

The frontend is designed by using Bootstrap and jquery and in backend I had used the dbsqlite to store the data
